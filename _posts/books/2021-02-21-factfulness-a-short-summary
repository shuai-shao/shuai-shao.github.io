In short, I did not learn much from this book.  
It's not because the points made in the book are not valid, but rather because I, with a scientific background and from a third-world country, have already known most of the ways of thinking taught in the book.  
A proof is that out of the 13 questions asked at the beginning of the book, I got 11 of them right, better than 99% of people according to the author.  
Nevertheless, I think this book will be useful for people who have not received rigorous scientific and statistical trainings, and who come from a more privileged background.
