1. As a leader, if you don't **do the work**, the people around you are going to know, and you loose their respect fast. You have to be attentive, you have to sit through meetings that, if given the choice, you might choose to not sit through. You have to listen to other people's problems and find solutions. It's all part of the job.  
2. How to **lead when entering into a new domain**: ask the question you need to ask. Admit without apology what you don't understand. Do the work to learn what you need to learn.  
3. Don't start negatively and don't start small. People will often focus on little details as a way of masking a lack of **clear coherent big thoughts**. If you start petty, you think petty  
4. Be comfortable with failure, not the lack of effort. Don't be in the business of playing it safe, be in the business of **creating possibilities for greatness**.   
5. Avoiding getting into the business of manufacturing "trombone oil" -- think about the **real impactful project**  
6. No more than 3 **priorities**. You should communicate your priorities clearly and often.  
7. Delivering bad news: try to as **direct** of about the problem as possible, explain why it isn't working and why I didn't think it was going to change. If you respect the person, then you owe them a **clear explanation** of the decision that you're making. There's no way for the conversation not to be painful. But at least it can be **honest**.
