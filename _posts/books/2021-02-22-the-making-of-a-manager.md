In summary, I like this book. Maybe because it's written by a former FB leader, and many principles sound all too familiar. Maybe it's also because some chapters speak directly to the problems I am currently facing and experiencing.  
These all make this book relatable and relevant, and it was a great pleasure reading it.  
Some notes:  
**C5: Managing yourself**
1. Get to brutal honest with yourself 
2. Find your strength:
	1. How would friends/families describe me in three words?
	2. What three qualities do I possess that I am mostly proud of?
	3. When I look back at something that was successful, what personal traits do I give credit to?
	4. What are the top three pieces of feedback that I received from my manager and peers?
3. Know your weaknesses
4. Great managements typically comes from playing to your strengths rather than from fixing your weaknesses. 
5. Asking for specific constructive feedback is not easy, since you may think it will confirm your imposter syndrome (that you ARE not good at something that you speculate you might be)
	1. use growth mindset, instead of fixed mindset 
6. Know what environment helps you do your best work:
	1. Do something productive early in the morning, which motivates me to keep the momentum going, and gives a sense of accomplishment that anchors the rest of the day 
		1. get up 30mins earlier in the morning
		2. read a book, think, and sort through and picture the rest of the day
	2. Schedule a half an hour 'daily prep' time so I can visualize how I want each meeting and task to go
		1. keep doing this - this has worked for me 
		2. and make this the first thing in the morning 
	3. Schedule 'thinking time' on calendar so I can sort through and write down my thoughts on big problems
		1. keep doing this 
7. Which part of my six-month I felt the most energetic and productive? What gave me that energy?  
	1. Focus on a new area and new problem, having the sense of learning and understanding more 
	2. Building something based on the new idea/methodology and make it work
	3. Being able to focus and follow my own schedule without much context switching 
8. Form a support group, and ask help from people you can be real with
9. Learning to be twice as good:
	1. Constantly asking for specific (task and behavioral) feedback
	2.  Treat your manager as a coach, not as a judge 
		1. The person most invested in your career isn't your manager, it's you.
		2. While it might be natural to think that if you ask your manager for help then it means you are not doing the job well enough on your own, it is not true
		3. Your manager is on your side, and your success leads to their success. 
		4. Ask your manager: what skills do you think I should work on in order to have more impact? Share your personal goals and enlist their help 
		5. See your 1:1s with your manager as an opportunity for focused learning 
	3. Make a mentor out of everyone 
		1. Ask for specific advice. "Hey I am really impressed with the way you do X. I'd love to learn from you. Would you be able to grab a coffee and share the approach?"
	4. Set aside time to reflect and set goals 

**C8: Making things happen**
1. Breakdown a big goal into smaller pieces
	1. Every big dream is a culmination of thousands of tiny steps forward. Treat big projects like a series of smaller projects 
	2. Worry about what's in front of, don't worry yet about what's months or years ahead 
	3. My goal of publication can be broken down to smaller projects, instead of treating it a one humongous project with far-out deadline. What's the goal for this week, this month? You will be more disciplined at hitting each smaller goal.

**C9: Leading a growing team**
1. Context switching all day, every day: as the team grows,  the capacity to spend long, focused blocks on a single project shrinks. 
	1. This is the job. It is common and you need to become comfortable with it. Accept the fact that there will always be a dozen big and small things to work through at any given time.  As the number of projects I am responsible for doubles, tripes, quadruples, your ability to do context switching also needs to keep pace. 
	2. Techniques to make this easier:
		1. Going through the calendar and prep for the meetings at each morning; efficient note-taking and task management 
		2. Reflection at the end of each week 
2. Delegate and trust other people who can do this equally well or better than you
	1. Try to double your leadership capacity every year 
	2. You will have a tendency to get attached to what you are doing. You may love the task itself or the sense of expertise and control it gives you.
	3. But the point of being a manager is not to satisfy your own ego; it's to improve the outcome of your projects and your team 
	4. Think about the projects you are working on, and how you can let others do their best job, and focusing on increasing the scope of the project.
