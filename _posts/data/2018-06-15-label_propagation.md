Label propagation

**Definition**
Label propagation is a semi-supervised learning algorithm that assigns labels to previously unlabeled data points. It is a type of transductive learning.

**Label Propagation on Graphs**
Only a subset of nodes in a graph is labeled. The task is to label  all nodes in a graph structure.  The underlying assumption is that linked nodes are correlated.
